# Population Genetics Scripts
Scripts that automate population genetics problems covered in BIOL 435, Molecular Evolution. Most problems taken from G. Coop (2022)  
  
Scripts with names that start with "ask_" ask for input, otherwise input must be passed in the command line in a specific order. Each script should have that specified order commented at the top.
