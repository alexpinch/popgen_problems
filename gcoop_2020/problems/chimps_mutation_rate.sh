# From G. Coop, Chapter 5, Question 1
# For this and the next question, assume that humans and chimps split around 
# 5.5x10^6 years ago, have a generation time of 20 years, that the speciation
# occurred instantaneously in allopatry with no subsequent gene flow, and the
# ancestral effective population size of the human and chimp common ancestor
# population was 10,000 individuals. Nachman and Crowell sequenced 12 pseudogenes
# in humans and chimps and found substitutions at 1.3% of the sites.
# A) What is the mutation rate per site per generation at these genes?
# B) All of the pseudogenes they sequenced are on the autosomes. What would your
# prediction be for pseudogenes on the X and Y chromosomes, given that fewer mutations
# occur in the female germline than in the male germline per generation.
